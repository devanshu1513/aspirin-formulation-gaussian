# Aspirin Formulation and Gaussian Analysis

This repository documents the synthesis of pharmaceutical-grade aspirin and its computational analysis using Gaussian software.

## Contents

- Wet-lab synthesis protocol and purification notes
- FTIR spectroscopic characterization
- Gaussian input and output files for theoretical calculations
- Data analysis scripts and yield/purity optimization results

## Structure

- `/synthesis/`: Experimental protocol, purification notes, FTIR spectrum
- `/gaussian/`: Gaussian input (`.com`) and output (`.log`) files
- `/data_analysis/`: Computational data, optimization code, processed results

## Main Findings

- Successful formulation and purification yielded pure aspirin (verified by FTIR)
- Gaussian DFT calculations accurately aligned with experimental spectra
- Process optimized for purity and yield

# Aspirin Synthesis Experimental Protocol

**Objective:**  
Synthesize aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) by esterification of salicylic acid with acetic anhydride.

## Materials
- Salicylic acid (2.0 g)
- Acetic anhydride (4.0 mL)
- Concentrated H2SO4 (few drops, as catalyst)
- Distilled water, ice

## Procedure
1. Place 2.0 g salicylic acid in a dry conical flask.
2. Add 4.0 mL acetic anhydride.
3. Carefully add 3-4 drops conc. H2SO4, swirl to mix.
4. Warm in a water bath at ~60Â°C for 15 minutes.
5. Pour the mixture into 50 mL cold distilled water, stir.
6. Collect crude aspirin by vacuum filtration.
7. Recrystallize the product from ethanol/water mixture.
8. Dry the purified aspirin at room temperature.

## Calculations
- Calculate % yield: (experimental mass / theoretical mass) * 100
